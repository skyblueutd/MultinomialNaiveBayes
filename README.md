# MultinomialNaiveBayes

It is a multinomial naïve Bayes classifier with Laplace smooth. Stop_words packages were imported to preprocess the text data. Classification accuracy is around 90%. 
To run the source code, please create the “train” and “test” files first. Then put your training and test folder into those files. In PyCharm, run the code like “python NaiveBayes.py ‘trainingpath’ ‘testpath’”
